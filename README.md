# Design Patterns
Design Patterns with O'Reilly's Head First Design Patterns.

If you want to watch them working, you'll able to compile or run with VSCode's extensions.

## Patterns that I learned and practiced:

### Strategy
Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors and uses delegation to decide which one to use.

### Observer
Allows objects to be notiﬁed when state changes.

### Decorator
Wraps an object to provide new behavior.

### Factory
Subclasses decide which concrete classes to create.

### Singleton
Ensures one and only object is created.

### Command
Encapsulates a request as an object.

### Adapter
Wraps an object and provides a different interface to it.

### Facade
Simpliﬁes the interface of a set of classes.

### Composite
Clients treat collections of objects and individual objects uniformly.

### Iterator
Provides a way to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its implementation.

### State
Encapsulates state-based behaviors and uses delegation to switch between behaviors.

### Proxy
Wraps an object to control access to it.

## Patterns that I know but I haven't studied yet:

### Lightweight
### Bridge
### Builder
### Interpreter
### Chain of responsability
### Mediator
### Memento
### Prototype
### Visitor
